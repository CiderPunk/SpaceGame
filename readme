I'm learning JavaScript, Html5, Git and Cloud 9 all at the same time! bear with me!

this will eventually be a multi-player internet enabled html5 thrust / space duel type game, but it'll probably go through a single player iteration first, I'm doing this from scratch for no particular reason other than I want to.
